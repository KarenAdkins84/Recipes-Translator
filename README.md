# Chef Rosetta

Deployed Application:

Chef Rosetta is an application that allows the user to search for recipes and then automatically translate the chosen recipe to Spanish. The name is a reference to the "Rosetta Stone".

## Description
This project was a collaboration between four full-stack web developers. We created a unique application that would use two server-side APIs. 

We chose to use RapidAPI to fetch the APIs that we needed to complete this project. In order to search for recipes, we chose "Recipes API". "DeepL Translator" was used to translate the recipes into Spanish. 

Another parameter of this project was to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. After looking at the different popular options, our team decided on Bulma. Bulma enabled us to create the columns and cards in the HTML. The header and footer of the application were solely styled with an original CSS file. The styling is meant to have an aesthetic of a modern kitchen. 

## How to Use Chef Rosetta
As you arrive on the page, you will see a search box. At first, you should type in a keyword to a recipe that you want to prepare. (Example: carrot) After a few seconds, several buttons will appear with recipe options that include your keyword. Once you have chosen the recipe, in the adjacent column, the recipe will appear in Spanish.

## Future Capabilites
The end goal of this application is to manipulate the "DeepL Translator API" to translate the recipes into multiple languages that the user can choose based on their preferred language.
